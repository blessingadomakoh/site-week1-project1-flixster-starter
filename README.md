### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The features in the lab did prepare me, like working with the forEach loop to see what context it's used. I felt unprepared for certain functions and knowing what was needed to complete specific parts of a function that may not have come up in the lab. However, online searches and peer collaboration helped me a lot with this issue.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have definitely implemented at least one stretch feature! I think allowing the stretch feature of movie video trailers being played would have been really cool and rewarding.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The html and css went well. The javascript was a lot more complicated than I expected. There was a lot of online searches I had to do to complete the project, which was good in that I feel as though I am better learning how to search.

The search function certainly did not go as planned. I struggled on that the most.

Something I noticed that my peer did that I would like to try next time is firstly, implement more into my css to have my website look more aesthetically pleasing. Also, I want to be more conscious of using the documentation of the technology that I am using like visiting mozilla.org more often for Javascript. It has proven to be very helpful.

### Open-source libraries used
